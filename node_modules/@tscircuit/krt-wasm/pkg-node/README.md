# Rust Grid Router

High-performance A* grid router implemented in Rust with Python bindings via PyO3.

**Current Version: 0.15.0**

## Features

- Grid-based A* pathfinding with octilinear routing (8 directions)
- Multi-source, multi-target routing
- Via cost and layer transitions
- BGA exclusion zone with allowed cell overrides
- Stub proximity costs to discourage routing near unrouted stubs (flat cost model for accurate heuristic estimation)
- **Turn cost penalty** for direction changes - encourages straighter paths with fewer wiggles
- **Cross-layer track attraction** for vertical alignment - attracts routes to stack on top of tracks on other layers
- **Layer cost preferences** - per-layer cost multipliers to prefer certain layers (e.g., keep signals on F.Cu, avoid B.Cu). Default: F.Cu=1.0x, others=3.0x
- **Pose-based routing with Dubins heuristic** for differential pair centerlines (orientation-aware A*)
- **Rectangular pad obstacle blocking** with proper rotation handling
- **Collinear via constraint** for differential pair routing (ensures clean via geometry)
- **Via exclusion zones** to prevent routes from conflicting with their own vias (for diff pair P/N offset tracks)
- ~10x speedup vs Python implementation

## Building

### Prerequisites

**Windows:**
1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
2. Install Visual Studio Build Tools:
   - Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - Run the installer and select **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
   - This installs the MSVC compiler and linker required by Rust

**Linux/macOS:**
1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
2. Ensure you have a C compiler (gcc/clang) installed

### Build Commands

**Recommended: Use the build script from the parent directory:**
```bash
python build_router.py
```

This builds the Rust module, copies the library to the correct location, and verifies the version.

To clean all build artifacts and compiled libraries:
```bash
python build_router.py --clean
```

**Manual build (alternative):**
```bash
cd rust_router
cargo build --release
```

### Installing the Python Module

After building, copy the compiled library to this directory:

**Windows:**
```bash
cp target/release/grid_router.dll grid_router.pyd
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cp target/release/libgrid_router.so grid_router.so
```

**macOS:**
```bash
cp target/release/libgrid_router.dylib grid_router.so
```

The `route.py` script automatically adds this directory to the Python path.

### Automatic Version Checking

When `route.py` starts, it automatically:
1. Checks that numpy is installed
2. Verifies the Rust library version matches `Cargo.toml`
3. Rebuilds automatically if there's a version mismatch

This ensures you're always running the correct version of the Rust router.

### Using maturin (alternative)

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop --release
```

## Usage from Python

```python
import grid_router
from grid_router import GridObstacleMap, GridRouter

# Check version
print(f"grid_router version: {grid_router.__version__}")

# Create obstacle map with 4 layers
obstacles = GridObstacleMap(4)

# Add blocked cells (from segments, pads, etc.)
obstacles.add_blocked_cell(100, 200, 0)  # gx, gy, layer
obstacles.add_blocked_via(150, 250)       # gx, gy

# Set stub proximity costs (optional - discourages routing near unrouted stubs)
obstacles.set_stub_proximity(180, 190, 3000)  # gx, gy, cost

# Set BGA exclusion zone (optional - blocks routing through this area)
obstacles.set_bga_zone(1859, 935, 2049, 1125)  # min_gx, min_gy, max_gx, max_gy

# Add allowed cells that override BGA zone blocking (for source/target stubs inside BGA)
obstacles.add_allowed_cell(1900, 1000)  # gx, gy

# Create router
router = GridRouter(via_cost=500000, h_weight=1.5)

# Route from sources to targets
sources = [(100, 200, 0), (101, 200, 0)]  # (gx, gy, layer)
targets = [(300, 400, 0), (301, 400, 0)]

path, iterations, stats = router.route_multi(obstacles, sources, targets, max_iterations=200000)

if path:
    print(f"Found path with {len(path)} points in {iterations} iterations")
    for gx, gy, layer in path:
        print(f"  ({gx}, {gy}) on layer {layer}")
    # stats contains A* search statistics (cells_expanded, heuristic_ratio, etc.)
else:
    print(f"No path found after {iterations} iterations")
```

## Benchmark

Run the full 32-net benchmark from the parent directory:

```bash
python route.py kicad_files/fanout_starting_point.kicad_pcb kicad_files/routed.kicad_pcb \
  "Net-(U2A-DATA_23)" "Net-(U2A-DATA_20)" ...
```

### Performance Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 32 net routing | ~7 seconds |
| Success rate | **32/32 (100%)** |
| Total iterations | ~285,000 |
| DRC violations | None (DATA nets) |

Speedup vs Python implementation: **~10x**

Note: With proper rectangular pad blocking using `int()` instead of `round()` for grid discretization, the router correctly places vias on QFN pads while maintaining clearance to adjacent pads.

## API Reference

### GridRouter

```python
router = GridRouter(via_cost: int, h_weight: float, turn_cost: int = 1000, via_proximity_cost: int = 1,
                    vertical_attraction_radius: int = 0, vertical_attraction_bonus: int = 0,
                    layer_costs: List[int] = None, proximity_heuristic_cost: int = 0)
```

Parameters:
- `via_cost`: Cost for layer transitions (scaled by 1000)
- `h_weight`: Heuristic weight (>1 for faster but less optimal routes)
- `turn_cost`: Cost for direction changes (encourages straighter paths, default 1000)
- `via_proximity_cost`: Multiplier for stub proximity cost when placing vias. Higher values discourage vias near stubs. Use 0 to block vias entirely in stub proximity zones.
- `vertical_attraction_radius`: Grid units radius for cross-layer track attraction (0 = disabled)
- `vertical_attraction_bonus`: Cost reduction for positions aligned with tracks on other layers
- `layer_costs`: Per-layer cost multipliers (1000 = 1.0x, 3000 = 3.0x). Affects movement cost, source initialization, and via transitions. Switching to a cheaper layer discounts via cost (can be free)
- `proximity_heuristic_cost`: Expected proximity cost per grid step added to heuristic (0 = auto-compute). Auto-computed as `max(stub, track, bga) * 0.375 * 1000 / grid_step`. This tightens the heuristic for boards with high proximity costs, dramatically reducing search space (up to 6x speedup).

Methods:
- `route_multi(obstacles, sources, targets, max_iterations, collinear_vias=False, via_exclusion_radius=0)` - Find path from any source to any target
  - `collinear_vias`: If True, after a via the route must continue straight for one step, then can only turn ±45° (for differential pair routing)
  - `via_exclusion_radius`: Grid cells to exclude around placed vias. Prevents the route from drifting near its own vias, which is important for diff pair routing where P/N tracks are offset from centerline.
  - Returns `(path, iterations, stats)` where:
    - `path`: `List[(gx, gy, layer)]` or `None`
    - `iterations`: Number of A* iterations
    - `stats`: Dict with search statistics (cells_expanded, cells_pushed, heuristic_ratio, expansion_ratio, etc.)
- `set_proximity_heuristic_cost(cost)` - Set the proximity heuristic cost before each route. Called by Python when source/target endpoints are inside a proximity zone.

### PoseRouter

Orientation-aware A* router using Dubins path length as heuristic. Used for differential pair centerline routing where start and end orientations are constrained by stub directions.

```python
router = PoseRouter(via_cost: int, h_weight: float, turn_cost: int, min_radius_grid: float,
                    via_proximity_cost: int = 50,
                    vertical_attraction_radius: int = 0, vertical_attraction_bonus: int = 0,
                    proximity_heuristic_cost: int = 0)
```

Parameters:
- `via_cost`: Cost for layer transitions (scaled by 1000)
- `h_weight`: Heuristic weight (>1 for faster but less optimal routes)
- `turn_cost`: Cost for 45° in-place turn (typically `min_radius * π/4 * 1000`)
- `min_radius_grid`: Minimum turning radius in grid units
- `via_proximity_cost`: Multiplier for stub proximity cost when placing vias (0 = block vias near stubs)
- `vertical_attraction_radius`: Grid units radius for cross-layer track attraction (0 = disabled)
- `vertical_attraction_bonus`: Cost reduction for positions aligned with tracks on other layers
- `proximity_heuristic_cost`: Expected proximity cost per grid step added to Dubins heuristic (0 = disabled). Tightens the heuristic for boards with high proximity costs, reducing search space. Note: Python passes 1/10th of the computed value for diff pairs due to the more constrained pose-based search.

Methods:
- `route_pose(obstacles, src_x, src_y, src_layer, src_theta, tgt_x, tgt_y, tgt_layer, tgt_theta, max_iterations, diff_pair_via_spacing=None)`
  - `src_theta`, `tgt_theta`: Direction indices 0-7 (0=East, 1=NE, 2=North, ..., 7=SE)
  - `diff_pair_via_spacing`: Optional grid units for P/N via offset check. When set, via placement verifies that both +offset and -offset positions perpendicular to heading are clear.
  - Returns `(path, iterations)` where path is `List[(gx, gy, theta_idx, layer)]` or `None`
- `route_pose_with_frontier(...)` - Same as `route_pose` but returns blocked cells on failure for blocking analysis
  - Returns `(path, iterations, blocked_cells)` where `blocked_cells` is a list of `(gx, gy, layer)` tuples
- `set_proximity_heuristic_cost(cost)` - Set the proximity heuristic cost before each route. Called by Python when source/target endpoints are inside a proximity zone.

Constraints enforced by PoseRouter:
- **First move straight**: First move from start must be in the start direction (no immediate turn)
- **Minimum turn radius**: Enforced for ALL route steps - turns must respect `min_radius_grid` to ensure smooth paths
- **Straight after via**: After placing a via, must continue straight for `min_radius_grid + 1` steps before turning (ensures P/N offset tracks clear vias before turning)
- **Diff pair via clearance**: When `diff_pair_via_spacing` is set, checks that P/N via positions (perpendicular offsets from centerline) are clear
- **Via proximity cost**: When `via_proximity_cost > 0`, vias near stubs incur a cost penalty instead of being blocked

The Dubins heuristic computes the shortest path length considering:
- Start and end positions
- Required start and end headings
- Minimum turning radius constraint

This produces smoother routes that properly respect entry/exit angles at pads.

## Version History

- **0.15.0**: Changed bus routing attraction from proximity-based to direction-based. The router now only gives attraction bonus when moving in the same direction as the neighbor path was moving, not just for being near it. This prevents spiraling behavior where strong attraction could cause the router to circle around the neighbor path instead of making progress toward the target. Same direction = full bonus, 45° off = 70% bonus, perpendicular or opposite = no bonus. Bonus has quadratic distance falloff (stronger near the guide path). Python-side changes: bus detection now tracks `clique_endpoint` (source vs target clustering), routes from clustered endpoints using single-direction mode, and uses dense path sampling for direction vectors.
- **0.14.0**: Added path attraction feature for bus routing. New `attraction_path`, `attraction_radius`, and `attraction_bonus` parameters to GridRouter. Routes can be attracted to a previously routed path (same layer only) using `set_attraction_path()`. Enables parallel routing of bus groups where each net follows its neighbor.
- **0.13.0**: Added layer direction preference feature. New `layer_direction_preferences` parameter (list of u8: 0=horizontal, 1=vertical, 255=none) and `direction_preference_cost` parameter (penalty for non-preferred direction moves). Encourages horizontal routing on some layers and vertical on others, creating more organized, human-like routing patterns.
- **0.12.2**: Reverted to flat proximity costs (removed direction-aware cost adjustment from v0.10.0). Testing showed flat costs produce better results: 19% fewer iterations, 40% faster, and improved routing success (100% vs 97.9% on benchmark). The direction-aware heuristic mismatch caused more search exploration than the "efficient zone exit" guidance saved. Removed dead code: `get_directional_proximity_cost()`, `add_proximity_zone_center()`, `add_proximity_zone_centers_batch()`, `clear_proximity_zone_centers()`, and `proximity_zone_centers` field.
- **0.12.1**: Made VisualRouter fully consistent with GridRouter. Added `turn_cost`, `via_proximity_cost`, `vertical_attraction_radius`, and `vertical_attraction_bonus` parameters. Updated to use direction-aware proximity costs (`get_directional_proximity_cost()` and `get_layer_proximity_cost()`) and cross-layer attraction. Visualization mode now produces identical iteration counts to non-visualization mode.
- **0.12.0**: Added proximity-aware heuristic for faster routing on dense boards. The heuristic now auto-estimates expected proximity costs per step based on stub/track/BGA proximity settings and radii, dramatically reducing search space (up to 6x speedup) while keeping high proximity costs to prevent blocking later routes. Formula: `sum(cost_i * radius_i) * factor` where factor defaults to 0.02 (tuned for ~5mm typical radius). Diff pair routing uses 1/10th of the factor due to the more constrained pose-based search. **Smart endpoint detection**: The heuristic is only applied when source or target is inside a proximity zone (checked via `is_in_any_proximity_zone()`); routes with both endpoints outside proximity zones use h=0 for optimal search. New `proximity_heuristic_cost` parameter and `set_proximity_heuristic_cost()` setter in both GridRouter and PoseRouter, `--proximity-heuristic-factor` CLI option (route.py and route_diff.py), and `GridRouteConfig.get_proximity_heuristic_cost()` method.
- **0.11.0**: Added A* search statistics collection. `route_multi` now returns `(path, iterations, stats)` where `stats` is a dict containing: `cells_expanded`, `cells_pushed`, `cells_revisited`, `duplicate_skips`, `path_length`, `path_cost`, `initial_h`, `final_g`, `via_count`, and computed metrics `heuristic_ratio`, `expansion_ratio`, `revisit_ratio`, `skip_ratio`. Enable stats printing with `--stats` flag.
- **0.10.0**: Added direction-aware proximity costs. When routing within stub or BGA proximity zones, steps moving away from zone centers cost less than steps moving towards them. This encourages the router to exit proximity zones efficiently. New methods: `add_proximity_zone_center()`, `add_proximity_zone_centers_batch()`, `clear_proximity_zone_centers()`, `get_directional_proximity_cost()`. Zone centers are automatically registered when adding stub/BGA proximity costs in Python (`add_stub_proximity_costs()`, `add_bga_proximity_costs()`). `clear_stub_proximity()` now also clears zone centers.
- **0.9.0**: Added `layer_costs` parameter to GridRouter and VisualRouter for layer preference routing. Per-layer cost multipliers (1000 = 1.0x) affect movement costs, source initialization penalty for expensive layers, and via transition costs. Switching to a cheaper layer discounts the via cost (can reduce to 0). Default in route.py: F.Cu=1.0x, all others=3.0x. Values must be 1.0-1000x.
- **0.8.4**: Added `vertical_attraction_radius` and `vertical_attraction_bonus` parameters to GridRouter (previously only in PoseRouter). Single-ended routing can now attract to tracks on other layers, consolidating routing corridors and leaving more room for through-hole vias.
- **0.8.3**: Added `via_proximity_cost` parameter to GridRouter (was only in PoseRouter). Multiplies stub proximity cost when placing vias - higher values discourage vias near stubs, 0 blocks vias entirely in stub proximity zones. Now both single-ended and diff pair routing respect via proximity costs. Added batch FFI operations (`add_blocked_cells_batch`, `remove_blocked_cells_batch`, `add_stub_proximity_costs_batch`) to reduce Python-Rust call overhead. Changed obstacle map to use reference-counted `HashMap<u64, u16>` instead of `HashSet<u64>` for correct incremental updates when nets share blocked cells.
- **0.8.2**: Added `turn_cost` parameter to GridRouter - penalizes direction changes to encourage straighter paths with fewer wiggles. Default is 1000 (same as ORTHO_COST). Configurable via `--turn-cost` CLI option.
- **0.8.1**: Added cross-layer track attraction for vertical alignment. New `vertical_attraction_radius` and `vertical_attraction_bonus` parameters to PoseRouter. New GridObstacleMap methods: `add_cross_layer_track()`, `get_cross_layer_attraction()`, `clear_cross_layer_tracks()`. Attracts routes to stack on top of tracks on other layers, consolidating routing corridors and leaving more room for through-hole vias.
- **0.8.0**: Added `via_proximity_cost` parameter to PoseRouter - allows vias near stubs with cost penalty instead of blocking (default: 10, set to 0 for old blocking behavior). Improved turn radius enforcement: minimum turn radius is now enforced for ALL route steps (not just near vias), ensuring smooth paths throughout. `straight_after_via` is based on `min_radius_grid + 1` instead of hardcoded 2 steps, preventing DRC violations where P/N tracks turn too sharply after vias. Added `route_pose_with_frontier()` method that returns blocked cells on failure for blocking analysis.
- **0.7.0**: Added `PoseRouter` with Dubins path heuristic for orientation-aware differential pair centerline routing. State space expanded to (x, y, θ, layer) where θ is one of 8 directions (45° increments). Dubins path length used as heuristic for better routing with prescribed start/end orientations.
- **0.5.1**: Added `via_exclusion_radius` parameter to prevent routes from conflicting with their own vias. Tracks via positions along each path and blocks moves that would cause P/N offset tracks to intersect P/N vias.
- **0.5.0**: Added `collinear_vias` parameter for differential pair routing - enforces symmetric via geometry: `±45° → D → VIA → D → ±45°` (requires 2 steps before via, approach within ±45° of previous, exit same as approach, then ±45° allowed)
- **0.4.0**: Performance and stability improvements
- **0.3.0**: Added `clone()` method for GridObstacleMap to support incremental obstacle caching
- **0.2.1**: Fixed `is_blocked()` to check blocked_cells before allowed_cells (prevents allowed_cells from overriding regular obstacles)
- **0.2.0**: Added `add_allowed_cell()` for BGA zone overrides, added `__version__` attribute
- **0.1.0**: Initial release with basic A* routing

## Pad Rotation and Rectangular Blocking

The `route.py` script uses rectangular pad blocking with proper rotation handling:

```python
# Pads are blocked with rectangular bounds based on their rotated dimensions
# For a QFN pad with size (0.875, 0.2) and 90° rotation:
# - Board-space size becomes (0.2, 0.875)
# - Via blocking zone: pad_half_x + via_radius + clearance in X
#                      pad_half_y + via_radius + clearance in Y

for pad in pads:
    # size_x and size_y are already rotated by kicad_parser.py
    # Use int() instead of round() to avoid over-blocking
    via_expand_x = int((pad.size_x / 2 + via_clear_mm) / grid_step)
    via_expand_y = int((pad.size_y / 2 + via_clear_mm) / grid_step)
    for ex in range(-via_expand_x, via_expand_x + 1):
        for ey in range(-via_expand_y, via_expand_y + 1):
            obstacles.add_blocked_via(gx + ex, gy + ey)
```

This ensures vias are only placed where they have proper clearance to all adjacent pads, even for tightly-spaced QFN pins (0.4mm pitch).
